## Adding Users/Editing User Settings

1. Users are added to a circle by clicking the Add Contributor button and users may be edited by clicking the pencil next to their name.

   **Take extra care when entering users information, their wallet address should be a valid address and not have any leading or trailing spaces, and cannot already be used in that circle.**

   \(If you have a large number of users reach out to us on the discord and we can assist with a CSV Upload\)

1. Then you can enter their name, starting tokens, admin status, force opt-out, and whether or not they can send GIVE

1. Force Opt Out will prevent the user from receiving Give. The user will be alerted to this change via the Telegram Bot, and on the allocations page. If they have had any give allocated prior to making that save it will all be removed, and users who had allocated to them will have to re-allocate to other users.
